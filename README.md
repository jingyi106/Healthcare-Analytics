This project focuses on applying clustering and classification techniques to determine if there are interesting groupings of counties with similar health outcomes 
and behaviors, and develop a predictive model to see which factors influence health outcomes.  Individuals and governments can use such a model to improve public health outcomes.

### Tasks performed
1) Exploratory data analysis and subsequent data preparation 
2) Conducted clustering using K-means to find noteworthy groupings of counties that have similar health outcomes and behaviors
3) Built predictive models (Linear Regression & Random Forest Regressor) to find most important factors in predicting premature death. Premature death is defined as the number of years of potential life lost before age 75 per 100,000 population. 
4) Suggestions for improving public health condition
